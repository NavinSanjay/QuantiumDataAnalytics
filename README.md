# QuantiumDataAnalytics
A virtual data analytic internship with Quantium through Forage. As part of the Quantium retail analytics team, the goal of this project is to evaluate and analyse the performance of change and recommend whether it has been successful. We will be looking at the Chips Category for retail stores across 1 year

## Goal:
The insights from the analysis will feed into the supermarketâ€™s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

## Part 1 - Purchasing Insights:
This notebook is to help the Category Mangager for Chips, gain a better understanding of the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour within the region


## Part 2 - Trial Control Stores:
This notebook is to help the Category Mangager for Chips test the impact of the new trial layouts with a data driven recommendation to whether or not the trial layout should be rolled out to all their stores.
